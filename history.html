<p>The original data source for the Sun Times Equivalence Thing was the <a href="https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/RS_OneYear">US Naval Observatory</a>. I wrote various programs in Scratch 2 to turn the USNO&rsquo;s data tables into STEQ files. When I moved away from the STEQ file, I switched to using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Tafkas/4742250">computeSunrise script</a> as a data source.</p>
<h2>(no file type)</h2>
<p>The original version of the Sun Times Equivalence Thing could only use one location: my hometown. Its data was hard-coded in, and it was stored in five lists:<br>
<ul>
<li class="nothing">sunrisehours: 7 7 7 7 7... </li>
<li class="nothing">sunriseminutes: :25&AM :25&AM :25&AM :25&AM :25&AM... </li>
<li class="nothing">sunsethours: 4 4 4 4 4... </li>
<li class="nothing">sunsetminutes: 46&PM :47&PM :48&PM :49&PM :50&PM... </li>
<li class="nothing">daylightduration: 9&hours&24&minutes 9&hours&25&minutes 9&hours&26&minutes 9&hours&28&minutes 9&hours&29&minutes... </li>
</ul>
When I created the International Version, with the ability to analyze any location in the world, I had to store this data outside of the program. The STEQ file was born! I simply kept the same format I had used in the original program, with each list stored in order, one after the other.<br><a href="archive/fortuna.txt">Click here for an example of the first kind of STEQ file!</a>
<h3>Why did I do it this way?</h3>
I used <a href="https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/Dur_OneYear">another USNO page</a> to calculate the daylight duration. I decided to store the format exactly as it would be outputted&mdash;easier at the time, but much more complicated in hindsight.
The USNO converter outputs its data in standard time all year, so I separated the hours and minutes for sunrise and sunset&mdash;this way, they can be dynamically adjusted in any given year depending on when DST starts and ends.
The reason there are so many ampersands is because I wrote the converter in Scratch 2. When exporting a list, Scratch 2 separates each item thereof by a space, so I kept the space as an item separator and used ampersands to replace spaces I wanted to keep within items.
<h2>STEQ-JUL</h2>
<p>Namesake: the month of July, when I created this format alongside updating the Sun Times Equivalence Thing<br>
This format is exactly the same as above, but it adds &ldquo;STEQ-JUL&rdquo; at the beginning of its files. It&rsquo;s a quick-and-dirty way to allow the converter to discern what is and isn't a valid file. <a href="archive/reykjavik2.txt">Here&rsquo;s an example.</a></p>
<h2>STEQ-DYN</h2>
<p>Namesake: &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;<br>
While STEQ-JUL stores its times in English-language format, STEQ-DYN replaces this with just numbers. This makes the files smaller in size and much more versatile and easy-to-read. <a href="archive/homeDYN.txt">Here&rsquo;s an example.</a></p>
<h2>STEQ-NDL</h2>
<p>Namesake: &ldquo;no daylight&rdquo; (rather than storing the duration of daylight within the file, it is generated upon reading)<br>
This format is the same as STEQ-DYN, but without the daylight duration. Since it is so similar to STEQ-DYN, every version of the Sun Times Equivalence Thing that can read STEQ-NDL files is backwards compatible with STEQ-DYN (except the version the former was introduced, steqintl3b3). <a href="archive/homeNDL.txt">Here&rsquo;s an example.</a></p>
<h2>STEQ-POL</h2>
<p>Namesake: &ldquo;polar&rdquo; (its converter had better support for edge cases that happen near the poles)<br>
STEQ-POL&rsquo;s converter added support for a few edge cases:
<ul>
<li class="dash">the sun rises, sets, and then rises twice in the same day (or vice versa). If there are two sunrises or sunsets, they are placed in the same space but separated by the letter d, like this: <code>0019d2356</code>.</li>
<li class="dash">the sun rises but does not set (or vice versa). This is represented with &ldquo;NULL&rdquo; in place of where the sunrise or sunset would go.</li>
</ul>
These cases only happen in polar locations around the beginning/end of midnight sun or polar night. They're what made STEQ-POL &ldquo;polar&rdquo; and so difficult to get working, and the increasing unwieldiness of these edge cases and STEQ files in general caused me to abandon both.</p>
<p>STEQ-POL was created to maintain maximum compatibility with USNO-provided data, which sometimes had these edge cases. Sun Times Equivalence Thing versions made since July 2019 use a different code base and cannot produce these edge cases. The HTML converter uses the same code base as STEQINTL versions after July 2019, and so its data does not cover the edge cases that STEQ-POL was meant to. Generating a STEQ-POL file here may not be as &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; as it could have been.

<p>Versions of the Sun Times Equivalence Thing compatible with STEQ-POL were also meant to add support for locations where the sun stayed above or below the horizon the entire day, but that support was never added. This is why you may have received a warning when trying to generate your own STEQ-POL file. No support for this type of location was ever added to a version of the Sun Times Equivalence Thing compatible with STEQ files; it was only added alongside the ability to generate data on-the-fly without the need of a converter.</p>
<p>Despite the STEQ file's discontinuation, modern versions of the Sun Times Equivalence thing still generate and analyze STEQ-POL files on-the-fly. When you create a STEQ-POL file using the generator, you are receiving the raw data that modern Sun Times Equivalence Thing versions generate internally.</p>
